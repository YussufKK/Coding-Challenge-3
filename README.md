# Coding-Challenge-3
# Car Class Implementation Challenge num3

## Overview

This project involves implementing a `Car` class in JavaScript to manage a car's speed with functionality to accelerate and brake. The HTML file provides a simple user interface to interact with the `Car` class.

## Files

- **Car.js**: Contains the `Car` class definition with methods to accelerate and brake.
- **index.html**: Provides a user interface to create instances of the `Car` class and interact with its methods.

## Tasks

1. **Car Class Constructor**:
   - Implemented a `Car` class with a constructor that initializes the `make` (brand of the car) and `speed` (current speed in km/h) properties.
   - Commit: "Create Car class with constructor for make and speed."

2. **Accelerate Method**:
   - Implemented an `accelerate` method in the `Car` class that increases the car's speed by 10 km/h and logs the new speed to the console.
   - Commit: "Add accelerate method to increase speed by 10 km/h."

3. **Brake Method**:
   - Implemented a `brake` method that decreases the car's speed by 5 km/h and logs the new speed to the console.
   - Commit: "Add brake method to decrease speed by 5 km/h."

4. **Create and Test Car Objects**:
   - Created two `Car` objects using the provided test data.
   - Tested the `accelerate` and `brake` methods on each object, calling each method multiple times to demonstrate functionality.
   - Commit: "Test accelerate and brake methods on Car instances."

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the car's make and initial speed in the provided input fields.
3. Use the "Accelerate" and "Brake" buttons to interact with the car.
4. The current status of the car, including its make and speed, will be displayed below the buttons.
